# CaneKit changelog

Build log for the hackathon. One entry per step; each ends with what to test on the phone.

## Steps 1–2 — project scaffold + depth engine (Fri Sep 11, pre-device)
- Xcode 27 RC (27A266a) installed; XcodeGen 2.46.0; `ios/project.yml`, `scripts/gen.sh` (watch-embed patch,
  `WATCH=0` phone-only mode, Secrets copy), `Makefile`, `scripts/test.sh` (works with CLT alone).
- `ios/Logic` SwiftPM package (Foundation-only): LaneMath, LaneReport/TileLevel, CueDecider + GeigerRate,
  GeoMath (haversine, bearings, OffCourseDetector, GeofenceTracker), Waypoint/Route/RouteBuilder,
  WatchMessage envelope, VLM request/response codecs, SpokenDistance. **49 unit tests green.**
- App: CaneKitApp, AppModel (capabilities, settings, thermal + battery, Camera Control counter),
  DepthEngine (main-actor owner) + DepthFrameProcessor (background ARSessionDelegate, gyro gate, 15 Hz,
  smoothed depth, AsyncStream), MeshClassifier (centre-face lookup, face budget, raw-value guard),
  CameraControlInteraction spike, LaneGridView + DebugFooter, Theme.swift design system (docs/design.md).
- Watch: scaffold app + WatchTheme. Route: `Resources/route_isr_cif.json` (9 OSM-verified waypoints, 989 m).
- Reviews: 4-dimension adversarial workflow on Logic (56 agents) → fixed the 1 s no-repeat bypass on cue
  changes, the geofence speed gate accepting CoreLocation's -1, Anthropic max_tokens; Muse review of the
  diff → idempotent `DepthEngine.start()`, ARError codes surfaced, mesh face budget, CKCard a11y label.
- Builds clean for the iOS Simulator under Swift 6 strict concurrency. Not yet run on a device.
- Test on device: app shows "Depth OK" with six live tiles; wall at 1 m ≈ 1.0 in all tiles; hand at the
  left edge → Left tiles red; raise the hand → Head row; swing the cane → SWEEPING; fps ≈ 15;
  note whether a Camera Control press increments the footer counter.

## Step 0 — phone-only reset (Thu Sep 10)
- Decision: iPhone 17 Pro Max is the only computer. ESP32 grip, ToF pod, buy list → stretch/historical.
- `ios/CaneKit/CaneBLE.swift` moved to `ios/stretch/` (out of the app).
- Docs rewritten for the phone-only build: `README.md`, `ios/README.md`, `docs/ideas.md` §5.1.
- Plan reviewed twice with Muse; spec deviations recorded in `ios/README.md` §2.
- Test on device: nothing yet (no Xcode on the build Mac until the 27 RC download lands).
